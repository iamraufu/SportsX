# Sports X
Why **Sports X**?
- We usually let something as X if we don't know. In my point of view, I actually don't know know what kind of Sports you will like. That is why I let it as "X" and named my website as *Sports X*

# Description
I used thesportsdb API to fetch the data and show it in the homepage using BootStrap Card Component. Moreover, I used React Router to show detail of the league whenever anyone click on the button and created a dynamic url to show image and other information. However, I used Font Awesome to show media icons and conditional formatting to show picture of male or female league type. Finally, I hosted the react app on netlify.
